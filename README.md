**Generations**

The image generations endpoint allows you to create an original image given a text prompt.
Generated images can have a size of 256x256, 512x512, or 1024x1024 pixels. Smaller sizes are faster to generate.
You can request 1-10 images at a time using the generate key parameter.
The more detailed the description, the more likely you are to get the result that you or your end user want.

**Caution**

The Image generation does not allow erotic or pornographic search, it is censored and have firewall regulations against such items.
